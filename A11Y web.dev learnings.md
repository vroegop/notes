## A11Y intro

As a webdeveloper it is my responsibility to help users getting access to the content I build an app around.
Therefore, users with limited accessibility need to be assisted.

In order to assist those users, a site needs a11y principles applied. These vary as such:

* Vision
  * Helping users that have limited visibility by using high-contrast colors
  * Using large enough fonts and enable the positibily of increasing those
  * Helping a user that has limited or no visibility with the use of screen-readers
  * Describe the meaning of control elements
  * Describe visual representations such as images and graphs
* Motor / Dexterity
  * Helping users that have limited dexterity by making navigation available through the keyboard
  * Enable voice access / control
  
  
Not all of these principles are applied easily, and some may cost a lot of time to implement and even more to maintain.
Use the A11Y principles wisely.
